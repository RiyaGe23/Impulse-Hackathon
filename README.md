# PEST DETECTION
ABSTRACT:
The principal idea which empowered us to work on the project PEST DETECTION is to ensure improved and better farming techniques for farmers.
Present Scenario:
The present scenario in the agricultural field is not proficient enough as the farmers have to face a lot of problems like survey the land manually for pest detection. Solution:
Here,image processing techniques are used for determing the pest affected plants and it provides maximum protection to crops and also much less use of pesticides which can ultimately lead to better crop management and production. 
Execution:
In our project we will have a flying drone which will have an IP camera with an SD card that will save the images captured and when we will  connect it to an android phone or laptop , it  will provide us with a full report about the pests using image processing.
Drone would be capable to hover at a place to take stable pictures, and then determine its path to automate its flight.

INTRODUCTION:
This method gives the pest density in a farm. The farmers are using large amounts of pesticides to kill pests which reduces quality of the produce as it indirectly affects our health. Another big disadvantage with conventional method is the killing of insects that kill the pests. 
This brought us the need for determining the amount of pests in our farm and to calculate the amount of pesticides needed. Manual method to achieve this is by counting the number of pests which is time consuming and not feasible. 
Therefore, we present the idea to bring a system using drones and image processing techniques to detecting the amount of pests in the farm using arduino.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENT:
The following are the hardware requirements for the project:
 IP Camera module : To capture and transfer the image
Arduino : A microcontroller which will do the following functions: hover, obstacle sensing and path determination
SD Card :  to save the captured images and further can be inserted in a mobile or a laptop.
Brushless Motors,Propeller Set : Flying the drone
Multi Copter Frame : A frame for the drone
A laptop/Android mobile : For report analysisThe following softwares are required for the project:
 
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT
OpenCV with C++/Python : It is a library which is designed for computational efficiency with a strong focus on real time applications.
Arduino IDE : The open-source Arduino Software (IDE) makes it easy to write code and upload it to the board. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. . This software can be used with any Arduino board.
 
 FUTURE SCOPE
 This project can be advanced to calculate the amount of pesticide needed to be used.
 We can access images and locations to reasearch which part of the farm is worst hit etc
